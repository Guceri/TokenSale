## Tokenize Project
 - extended use of openzeppelin contracts (ownable, crowdsale, ERC20, IERC20)
 - worked with newer ERC20 contract functionality ( ie. _mint() )
 - introduce the idea of crowdsale contracts (outdated for general practice)
 - reinforce & practice contract inheritance, overriding functions (use of super)
 - working with .new() and .deployed() within test scripts
